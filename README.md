# Mage Clash
Mage Clash is a rock-paper-scissors game.

Originally based on a video by Ania Kub√≥w for freeCodeCamp (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec8vSKJuZTk)

After coding along, I actually rebuilt the whole thing from scrap and then adjusted it for what I wanted to do.

Home - landing page and brief introduction to the app
App - click on a magic circle to cast a spell, the CPU will also cast. Loser of the round loses one hit point. Losing all ten loses the game.
Code - full javascript code for the project
Git - check out the code on github
Shane - my portfolio...eventually
